# Real-Time_object_Detection
Developed a real-time object detection system using YOLO and OpenCV, enabling fast and accurate identification of multiple objects through live webcam feed. Leveraged YOLOv3/v4 with pre-trained weights for efficient processing and accurate bounding box predictions in a lightweight Python implementation.
