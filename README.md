# Real-Time_object_Detection
Developed a real-time object detection system using YOLO and OpenCV, enabling fast and accurate identification of multiple objects through live webcam feed. Leveraged YOLOv3/v4 with pre-trained weights for efficient processing and accurate bounding box predictions in a lightweight Python implementation.

# Features
Real-time object detection on webcam or video input

Fast and accurate detection using YOLOv3/v4/v5

Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores

Supports custom-trained YOLO models

# Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

YOLOv3/v4/v5 (Darknet or PyTorch implementation)

NumPy

# Use Case
Ideal for surveillance, automation, robotics, and any application requiring live object tracking with minimal latency.
